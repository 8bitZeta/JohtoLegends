Pokémon Johto Legends

A custom Pokémon ROM Hack based on the pokecrystal16 16-bit expansion
of Pokémon Crystal created by aaaaaa123456789.

This is a prequel to Pokémon Crystal, where you play as either Draco or
Dahlia, and travel the Johto Region, collect the eight badges, and discover
a conspiracy to take over the region from the shadows.


Features

Thanks to the expansion, we were able to go beyond the usual 256 limit, and
now there are 311 Pokémon from Generations 1-4 and 6. There is also 386 moves,
ranging from Generations 1-7, and a few original moves.

Moves have been altered to fit their more modern versions.

New items to evolve Pokémon that had unique evolutions in the original
game.

70 TMs and 17 Move Tutor Moves.

Download and Play

Download a ROM of Crystal with the name: Pokemon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.1) [C][!]

It has to be v1.1 for the patch to work.

Below is a link to the current patch, Version 0.1 Beta.

https://www.mediafire.com/file/a9deoyf5loctcc4/johtolegendsv0.1.ips/file

Patch the ROM with the patch, and it is all set.

Please use an accurate emulator, such as BGB64 or mGBA. BGB64 is a debugger, and
thus you will need to run without breaks, and can be done by pressing
Shift + F9. Otherwise, you will be interrupted constantly. Emulators such as
VBA and MyOldBoy will not emulate the hack correctly.

If you are knowledgeable on downloading Github depositories, then feel free
to clone and make the ROM from the repository.
